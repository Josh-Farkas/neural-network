# neural-network

This is an implementation of a basic neural network as a class called Network

- Constructs a network of weights and biases with starting values as random normal values
- Feeds forward inputs to get outputs
- Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network on input data using mini batches
for performance reasons.





Used http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ as reference, however almost all code written is my own
though some lines turned out to be the exact same since that's the best way to do it (mostly the list comprehension)
